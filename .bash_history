This answer assumes that you are using Linux, and that you want to install it in a non-standard way / place, and a bunch of other things. A better answer would be "just follow the installation instructions on the download website" ... unless you are using Ubuntu, in which case there are other ways to do it. â€“ Stephen C Jun 5 '12 at 9:41

For those needing JCE8 as well, you can download

curl -L -C - -b "oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" -O http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jce/8/jce_policy-8.zip
Or

wget --no-check-certificate -c

This works for the JDK 6, you just need to replace the download url with the latest version.

All of the abo

Oracle provide persistent links to the latest updates of each Java version as documented at https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=397248601136938&id=1414485.1 - though you need to create/log in to an Oracle Support account. *Otherwise you can only access the last "public" update of each Java version, e.g. 1.6_u45 (Mar 2013; Latest update is u65, Oct 2013)*

Once you know the persistent link, you should be able to resolve it to the real download; The following works for me

ME=<myOracleID>
PW=<myOr

echo "G

I solve this (for Debian based Linux distros) by making packages using java-package a few times (for various architectures), then distributing them internally.

The big plus side is that this method always works; no matter how crazy Oracle's web pages become. Oracle can no longer break my build!

The downside is that it's a bit more work to set up initially.

Download the tar.gz files manually in a browser (thus "accepting" their terms)

On the receiving end, if you have a password protected apt repo, all you need to do is apt-get install it. If you have raw packages, download, decrypt and dpkg -i them. Works like a charm!

The accepted answer was not working for me, as of 2017-04-25. However, the simple solution was using the -b flag instead of the --header option.

For example, to get jdk-1.8_131:

version='8u131'; wget -H -O jdk-$version-linux-x64.tar.gz --no-check-certificate --no-cookies -b "oraclelicense=a" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/$version-b11/jdk-$version-linux-x64.tar.gz
That will execute in the background, writing output to wget-log.

I recently faced the same problem and although the comments on this page and some others provided helpful hints - I thought it would be good to document the steps I

System Details

I am following the PNDA set up on AW

https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-guide/blob/develop/provisioning/aws/PREPARE.md
I am using ubuntu 14.04 [free tier eligible] on AWS cloud, and am running the code from 64 bit windows8.1 laptop. I am using PUTTY to connect to the server instance. I git cloned the pnda code from https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda to the ubuntu instance.

Important Note Please note that if you plan to use Ubuntu instance on AWS make sure it's 14.04 only. If you use version 16, it does not work. I learnt it the hard way!

Resolution Steps

As those who have gone as far as to have encountered the error being discussed here would know - the mirror creation file involves the following steps -

1) Run the script create_mirror.sh [ sudo su -s ./create_mirror.sh ] to run the full mirror creation process

2) This script in turn calls various other scripts - one of them being create_mirror_misc.sh; this script refers to pnda-static-file-dependencies.txt which has a list of files to be downloaded.

3) On the very first line of the pnda-static-file-dependencies.txt is a reference to download the jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz file from  http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u131-b11/d54c1d3a095b4ff2b6607d096fa80163/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie; It is at this point that my script was failing with the message Failed to download http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u131-b11/d54c1d3a095b4ff2b6607d096fa80163/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz after 3 retries

4) I browsed to the page http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u131-b11/d54c1d3a095b4ff2b6607d096fa80163/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz and found the following error message displayed **In order to download products from Oracle Technology Network you must agree to the OTN license terms**

5) To resolve this problem I made the following change to the pnda-static-file-dependencies.txt; I added --no-check-certificate --no-cookies to bypass the license term agreement condition

6) So the revised code looks like - http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u131-b11/d54c1d3a095b4ff2b6607d096fa80163/jdk-8u131-linux-x64.tar.gz --no-check-certificate --no-cookies oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie

I hope this is helpful.

Why not click to download from your browser then copy & paste the exact link where it was downloaded, for example:

wget http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u40-b43/jdk-7u40-linux-x64.tar.gz?AuthParam=1380225131_dd70d2038c57a4729d8c0226684xxxx
You can find out the link by looking at the network tab of your browser after accepting terms in oracle and clicking to download. F12 in Chrome. Firebug in Firefox.
